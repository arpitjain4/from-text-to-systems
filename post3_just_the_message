Why bits break once they leave memory!

In the last post [https://lnkd.in/gigscMu8], we saw that bits can flip once they leave memory.
But we were still cheating a little — we flipped bits on purpose.

In the real world, bits don’t get flipped directly.

To communicate, information has to become something physical.
Voltage on a wire.
Energy in the air.

And the moment information leaves memory and turns into a signal, the world starts interfering.

Here’s the part we usually skip thinking about:

The receiver never sees only the message.

It always sees what was sent + what the world added.

Now pause for a second.

What if the channel is a copper wire?
What if it’s air?
What if it’s water, light, or something else entirely?

Is the disturbance the same in all cases?
Does every medium affect energy in the same way?

Of course not.

Wires guide energy along a controlled path.
Air lets energy spread, reflect, collide, and fade.

Distance weakens signals.
Interference reshapes them.
And by the time a signal reaches the receiver, it has already been negotiated by the physical world.

The receiver doesn’t read bits.
It infers intent from a distorted observation.

Nothing has gone wrong yet.
This is simply what it means to communicate through reality.

You might notice there’s no code in this post.
That’s intentional — this one is about the message before engineers try to tame the noise.

The next question engineers had to answer was:

How do we describe this mess in a way we can actually design systems around?

That’s where noise stops being hand-wavy — and becomes a model.
