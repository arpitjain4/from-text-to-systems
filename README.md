# From Text to Systems

This repository is a practical exploration of how everyday digital information
moves through communication systems — starting from raw text and gradually
building up toward real-world networks.

The goal is simple:
to understand **what actually happens** between typing a message and receiving it,
using small, visual, and reproducible simulations.

## Why this repository exists

Modern systems feel magical:
messages appear instantly, images load seamlessly, and calls just work.

Under the hood, all of this relies on layers of ideas that are often taught
independently — encoding, signal processing, noise, estimation, optimization,
and networking.

This repository connects those ideas through **one continuous thread**.

Not theory-first.
Not black-box tools.
But concepts explained by building them step by step.

## How this is structured

Each folder corresponds to a post or concept, and builds on the previous one.

You don’t need all files at once.
You can start anywhere — but earlier scripts act as foundations for later ones.

## Who this is for

- Students who want intuition, not memorization  
- Working engineers who want to reconnect theory with practice  
- Anyone curious about how digital systems actually work  

No prior expertise required — just curiosity.

## How to use

- Clone the repository
- Run the scripts with Python 3.x
- Modify inputs
- Break things intentionally
- Observe what changes

Each script is designed to be:
- short
- readable
- reusable in later experiments

## Status

This is an evolving lab notebook.
Files will grow gradually as concepts build on each other.

The goal is not completeness —
the goal is understanding.
