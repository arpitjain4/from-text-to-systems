# from-text-to-systems
From text to systems is a hands-on learning repository that builds communication systems from first principles — starting with how text becomes bits, bits become signals, and signals become real-world wired and wireless systems.  The goal is to explain complex ideas in simple, visual, and practical ways through simulations and experiments.
